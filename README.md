## 🎬 Bonus Content

- 🧠 I think in flowcharts but act like I’m in a heist movie  
- 🎨 A good UI should feel like a well-brewed cup of tea: warm, clean, and a little dramatic  
- 🌈 I believe buttons should have good padding *and* good energy  
- ⏱ Peak productivity time? 11:59 PM the night before a deadline

### ⚡ TL;DR?

I code, I create, I question reality during build errors — and I probably like my README cooler than yours 😌
